<p class="blockquot">"A new domain has been won for poetry
by the war&mdash;that of the air. This is of greater
importance than the bare statement suggests....
'The Dawn Patrol' marks so notable a
departure in English literature that it will in
after years be eagerly sought by collectors....
Mr. Bewsher's most considerable triumph is
to have been the first airman-poet to regard
humanity from the detached standpoint of the
sky."&mdash;<i>Daily Graphic.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="blockquot">"The fable of Pegasus is come true....
Mr Bewsher never strains for effect....
The strongest impression his poems leave is
of a sincere and ingenuous nature devoted to
duty, but of keen sensibilities."&mdash;<i>The Times.</i></p>

<tr><td>
Sometimes I fly at dawn above the sea,<br />
Where, underneath, the restless waters flow&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Silver, and cold, and slow.</span><br />
Dim in the East there burns a new-born sun,<br />
Whose rosy gleams along the ripples run,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Save where the mist droops low,</span><br />
Hiding the level loneliness from me.<br />
<br />
And now appears beneath the milk-white haze<br />
A little fleet of anchored ships, which lie<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In clustered company,</span><br />
And seem as they are yet fast bound by sleep,<br />
Although the day has long begun to peep,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With red-inflamèd eye,</span><br />
Along the still, deserted ocean ways.<br />
<br />
The fresh, cold wind of dawn blows on my face<br />
As in the sun's raw heart I swiftly fly,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And watch the seas glide by.</span><br />
Scarce human seem I, moving through the skies,<br />
And far removed from warlike enterprise&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like some great gull on high</span><br />
Whose white and gleaming wings beat on through space.<br />
<br />
Then do I feel with God quite, quite alone,<br />
High in the virgin morn, so white and still,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And free from human ill:</span><br />
My prayers transcend my feeble earth-bound plaints&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span><br />
As though I sang among the happy Saints<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With many a holy thrill&mdash;</span><br />
As though the glowing sun were God's bright Throne.<br />
<br />
My flight is done. I cross the line of foam<br />
That breaks around a town of grey and red,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whose streets and squares lie dead</span><br />
Beneath the silent dawn&mdash;then am I proud<br />
That England's peace to guard I am allowed;&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then bow my humble head,</span><br />
In thanks to Him Who brings me safely home.<br/>

When heavy on my tired mind<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The world, and worldly things, do weigh,</span><br />
And some sweet solace I would find,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Into the sky I love to stray,</span><br />
And, all alone, to wander round<br />
In lone seclusion from the ground.<br />
<br />
Ah! Then what solitude is mine&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From grovelling mankind aloof!</span><br />
Their road is but a thin-drawn line:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their busy house a scarce-seen roof.</span><br />
That little stain of red and brown<br />
They boast about!&mdash;It is their town!<br />
<br />
How small their petty quarrels seem!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Poor, crawling multitudes below;</span><br />
Which, like the ants, in feverish stream<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From place to place move to and fro!</span><br />
Like ants they work: like ants they fight,<br />
Assuming blindly they are right.<br />
<br />
Soon their existence I forget,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In joy that on these flashing wings</span><br />
I cleave the skies&mdash;O! let them fret&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now know I why the skylark sings</span><br />
Untrammelled in the boundless air&mdash;<br />
For mine it is his bliss to share!<br />
<br />
Now do I mount a billowy cloud,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now do I sail low o'er a hill,</span><br />
And with a seagull's skill endowed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Circle, and wheel, and drop at will&mdash;</span><br />
Above the villages asleep,<br />
Above the valleys, shadowed deep,<br />
<br />
Above the water-meadows green<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whose streams, which intermingled flow,</span><br />
Like silver lattice-work are seen<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A-gleam upon the plain below&mdash;</span><br />
Above the woods, whose naked trees<br />
Move new-born buds upon the breeze.<br />
<br />
And far away above the haze<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I see white mountain-summits rise,</span><br />
Whose snow with sunlight is ablaze<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And shines against the distant skies.</span><br />
Such thoughts those towering ranges bring<br />
That I float on a-wondering!<br />
<br />
So do I love to travel on<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through lonely skies, myself alone;</span><br />
For then the feverish fret is gone<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which on this earth I oft have known.</span><br />
Kind is the God who lets me fly<br />
In sweet seclusion through the sky!<br />

<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The rich, red blood</span><br />
Doth stain the fair, green grass, and daisies white<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">In generous flood ...</span><br />
This sun-drowsed day for me is darkest night.<br />
O! wreck of splintered wood and twisted wire,<br />
What blind, unmeasured hatred you inspire<br />
Because yours was the power that life to end ...<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Of him, who was my friend!</span><br />
<br />
This morn we lay upon the grass,<br />
And watched the languid hours pass;<br />
A lark, deep in the sky's blue sea,<br />
Sang ecstasies to him and me.<br />
<br />
And with the daisies did he play,<br />
As on the waving grass we lay,<br />
And made a little daisy chain<br />
To bring his childhood back again.<br />
<br />
And while he watched the clouds above<br />
He drifted into thoughts of love.<br />
He said, "I know why skylarks sing&mdash;<br />
Because they love, and it is Spring.<br />
<br />
And if I had a voice as they,<br />
So would I sing this golden May,<br />
Because I love, and loved am I,<br />
And when I wander through the sky,<br />
<br />
I wish I had a skylark's voice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span><br />
And with such singing could rejoice.<br />
Oh, happy, happy, are these days!<br />
My heart is full of deep-felt praise,<br />
<br />
And thanks to God who brings this bliss!<br />
Oh! what a happiness is this&mdash;<br />
To lie upon the grass and know<br />
In two short days that I shall go<br />
<br />
And see my Love's fair face again,<br />
And wander in some flowery lane,<br />
Forgetting all the world around,<br />
And only knowing I have found<br />
<br />
A Spring enchantment, which is mine<br />
Through God's sweet sympathy divine, ...<br />
May these two days now swiftly pass!"<br />
He laughed upon the sunlit grass.<br />
<br />
The days have passed, but passed, alas! how slow!<br />
See down the road a sad procession go!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Oh! hear the wailing music moan!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Why? Why such grief am I to know?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Dear God! I wish I were alone.</span><br />
For by the grave a girl with streaming eyes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Doth make mine dim.</span><br />
While high among the sunny springtime skies,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The larks still hymn.</span><br />

Around me broods the dim, mysterious Night,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Star-lit and still.</span><br />
No whisper comes across the Plain,<br />
Asleep beneath the breezes light,<br />
Which scarcely stir the growing grain.<br />
Slow chimes the quiet midnight hour<br />
In some unseen and distant tower,<br />
While round me broods the vague, mysterious Night,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Star-lit, and cool, and still.</span><br />
<br />
And I must desecrate this silent time<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Of drowsy dreams!</span><br />
On mighty wings towards the sky,<br />
Towards the stars, I have to climb<br />
And o'er the sleeping country fly,<br />
And such far-echoing clamour make<br />
That all the villages must wake.<br />
So must I desecrate this quiet time<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Of soft and drowsy dreams!</span><br />
<br />
The hour comes ... soon must I say farewell<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">To this fair earth.</span><br />
Then to my little room I go<br />
Where I perhaps no more shall dwell.<br />
Shall I return?&mdash;The Gods but know.<br />
Perchance again I shall not sleep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span><br />
On that white bed in silence deep.<br />
For soon the hour comes to say farewell<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">To this fair, friendly earth.</span><br />
<br />
I stand there long, before into the gloom<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">I take my way.</span><br />
There are the pictures of my friends<br />
And all the treasures of my room<br />
On which my lamp soft radiance sends.<br />
And long with lingering gaze I look<br />
Upon each much belovèd book.<br />
I stand, and dream&mdash;before into the gloom<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">I sadly take my way.</span><br />
<br />
And now I gain the field whence I must part<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Upon my quest.</span><br />
My Pegasus of wood and steel<br />
Is ready straining at the start.<br />
The governor is at the wheel&mdash;<br />
And, with an ever-growing roar,<br />
Across the hidden fields we soar.<br />
So, with one envious look from Earth I part<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Upon my midnight quest.</span><br />
<br />
Beneath me lies the sleeping countryside<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Hazy and dim,</span><br />
And here and there a little gleam,<br />
Like stars upon the heavens wide,<br />
Speaks of some wretch who cannot dream&mdash;<br />
But on his bed all night must toss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span><br />
And hear me as I pass across,<br />
In droning flight above the countryside,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Hazy, and huge, and dim.</span><br />
<br />
And in the great blue night I ever rise<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Towards the stars,</span><br />
As to the hostile lands I sail<br />
High in the dark and cloudless skies<br />
Whose gloom our gloomy wings doth veil.<br />
Beneath, a scarce-seen ribbon shows<br />
Where through the woods a river flows,<br />
As in the shadowy night I ever rise<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Towards the scattered stars.</span><br />
<br />
Now high above War's frontiers do I sit&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Above the lines.</span><br />
Great lights, like flowers, rise and fall:<br />
On either side red flashes spit<br />
Hot death at those poor souls which crawl<br />
On secret errands. O, how grim<br />
Must be that midnight slaughter dim!<br />
And happy am I that so high I sit<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Above those cruel lines!</span><br />
<br />
Each man beneath me now detests my race<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">With iron hate.</span><br />
Each tiny light I see must shine<br />
Upon some grim, unfriendly face,<br />
Who curses England's name and mine,<br />
And would be glad if both were gone&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span><br />
But steadily must I fly on,<br />
Though every soul beneath me loathes my race<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">With stern, unceasing hate.</span><br />
<br />
I see a far-flung City all ablaze<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">With jewelled lamps:</span><br />
I trace its quays, its roads, its squares,<br />
And all its intermingled ways,<br />
And, as I wonder how it dares<br />
To flaunt itself,&mdash;the City dies,<br />
And in an utter darkness lies,<br />
For I have terrified that town ablaze<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">With twinkling, jewelled lamps.</span><br />
<br />
But, see!&mdash;the furnace with its ruddy breath<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Which I must wreck!</span><br />
The searchlights sweep across the sky&mdash;<br />
Long-fingered ministers of Death&mdash;<br />
I look deep in their cold blue eye,<br />
Incessant shells with blinding light<br />
Show every wire, clear and white!<br />
There is the furnace with its ruddy breath<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Which I must wreck;&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
It lies beneath&mdash;my time has come at last<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">To do my work!</span><br />
I wait&mdash;O! will you never stop<br />
Your fearful shells, that burst so fast?&mdash;<br />
And then&mdash;I hear destruction drop<br />
Behind my back as I release<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span><br />
Such fearful death with such great ease.<br />
Burst on, you shells! My time has come at last<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">To do my deadly work.</span><br />
<br />
Then do I turn, and hurry swiftly back<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Towards my home.</span><br />
I gladly leave that place behind!<br />
No more I hear the shrapnel's crack&mdash;<br />
No more my eyes the searchlights blind.<br />
I cross the lines with lightening breast<br />
And sail into the friendly West.<br />
How glad am I to hurry swiftly back<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Towards my peaceful home!</span><br />
<br />
I reach the field&mdash;and then I softly land.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">My work is o'er!</span><br />
I leave my hot and panting steed,<br />
And clasp a comrade's outstretched hand,<br />
And with him to my bedroom speed.<br />
Then, over steaming beakers set,<br />
The night's fierce menace soon forget.<br />
How great a welcome waits me when I land&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">When all my work is o'er!</span><br />
<br />
But ere I search shy sleep on my white bed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">I greet the dawn,</span><br />
And think, with heart weighed down with grief,<br />

The long and tedious months move slowly by<br />
And February's chill has fled away<br />
Before the gales of March, and now e'en they<br />
Have died upon the peaceful April sky:<br />
And still I sadly wander, still I sigh,<br />

Is dyed, for me, one melancholy grey,<br />
And all its beauty can but make me cry.<br />
<br />
For thou art silent, Oh! far distant friend,<br />
And not one word has come to cheer my heart<br />
Through these sad months, which seem to have no end,<br />
So distant seems the day which bade us part!<br />
Oh speak! dear fair-haired angel! Spring has smiled,<br />

The day is cold; the wind is strong;<br />
And through the sky great cloud-banks throng,<br />
While swathes of snow lie on the ground<br />
O'er which I walk without a sound,<br />
But I have vowed to fly to-day<br />
Though winds are fierce, and clouds are grey.<br />
My aeroplane is on the field;<br />
So I must fly&mdash;my fate is sealed,<br />
And no excuses can I make;<br />
Within its back my place I take.<br />
I strap myself inside the seat<br />
And press the rudder with my feet,<br />
And hold the wheel with nervous grip<br />
And gaze around my little ship&mdash;<br />
For on its wire-rigging taut<br />
Depends my life&mdash;which will be short<br />
If it should fail me in the air;<br />
Swift then my fall, and short my prayer,<br />
And these my wings would be my pyre&mdash;<br />
So well I scrutinise each wire!<br />
Then out across the field I go<br />
In shaking progress,&mdash;noisy&mdash;slow;<br />
And turn, until the wind I face,<br />
Then do I look around a space;<br />
For fear to-day is at my heart<br />
And nervously I fear to start.<br />
The field is clear&mdash;the skies are bare&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span><br />
Mine is the freedom of the air!<br />
And yet I sit and hesitate,<br />
Although each moment that I wait<br />
Brings to my soul a greater fear.<br />
To me the grass seems very dear&mdash;<br />
Dear seems the hut where dreams have crept<br />
To me each midnight as I slept&mdash;<br />
Dear seems the river, by whose brink<br />
I oft have watched brown pebbles sink<br />
Deep in the crumbling bridge's shade,<br />
Where in the evening I have strayed!<br />
My restless hands hold fast the wheel;<br />
Once more the wing-controls I feel.<br />
I move the rudder with my feet,<br />
And settle firmly in the seat.<br />
I start, and o'er the snowy grass<br />
In ever quicker progress pass:<br />
On either side the ground streaks by,<br />
And soon above the grass I fly.<br />
I feel the air beneath the wings;<br />
At first a greater ease it brings&mdash;<br />
But soon the stormy strife begins,<br />
And if I lose, 'tis Death who wins.<br />
The winds a thousand devils hold,<br />
Who grasp my wings with fingers bold,<br />
And keep me ceaselessly a-rock&mdash;<br />
I seem to hear those devils mock<br />
As I am thrown from side to side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span><br />
In unseen eddies, terrified&mdash;<br />
As suddenly I start to drop,<br />
And when my plunging fall I stop,<br />
Up am I swiftly thrown once more!<br />
Like no great eagle do I soar,<br />
But like a sparrow tempest-tost<br />
I struggle on! My faith is lost:<br />
My former confidence is dead,<br />
And whispering fear has come instead.<br />
Death ever dogs me close behind&mdash;<br />
My frightened soul no peace can find.<br />
I feel a torture in each nerve,<br />
As to the right or left I swerve.<br />
And now Imagination brings<br />
Its evil thoughts&mdash;I watch the wings,<br />
And wonder if those wings will break&mdash;<br />
The tight-stretched wires seem to shake.<br />
I see the ghastly, headlong rush,<br />
And picture how the fall would crush<br />
My helpless body on the ground.<br />
With haggard eyes I turn around,<br />
And contemplate the rocking tail,&mdash;<br />
My drawn and sweating cheeks are pale.<br />
Fear's clammy hands clutch at my heart!<br />
I try, with unavailing art,<br />
To summon thoughts of peaceful hours<br />
Spent in some sunny field of flowers<br />
When my half-opened eyes would look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span><br />
On some old dream-inspiring book,<br />
And not on this accursèd wheel,<br />
And on this box of wood and steel<br />
In which at pitch-and-toss with Death,<br />
I play, and wonder if each breath<br />
I tensely draw, will be my last.<br />
The happy thoughts are swiftly past&mdash;<br />
My frightened brain forbids them stay.<br />
Dear London seems so far away,<br />
And far away my well-loved friends!<br />
Each second my existence ends<br />
In my disordered mind, whose pace<br />
I cannot check&mdash;its cog-wheels race,<br />
Like some ungoverned, whirring clock,<br />
When, frenziedly, it runs amok.<br />
I have resolved that I will climb<br />
A certain height&mdash;how slow seems time<br />
As on its sluggish pivot creeps<br />
The laggard finger-point, which keeps<br />
The truthful record. O, how slow<br />
Towards the clouds I seem to go!<br />
And then ambition gains its mark at last!<br />
The little finger o'er the point has passed!<br />
I can descend again. With conscience clear<br />
And end this battle with persistent fear!<br />
The engine's clamour dies&mdash;there is no sound<br />
Save whistling wires&mdash;as towards the ground<br />
I gently float. My agony is gone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span><br />
What peace is mine as I go gliding on!<br />
Calm after storm&mdash;contentment after pain&mdash;<br />
Soft sleep to some tempestuous, burning brain&mdash;<br />
The soothing harbour after foamy seas&mdash;<br />
The gentle feeling of a perfect ease&mdash;<br />
All, all are mine&mdash;though yet by gusts distressed!<br />
Near is the ground, and with the ground comes rest.<br />
Above the trees I glide&mdash;above the grass,<br />
Above the snow-besprinkled earth I pass.<br />
I touch the ground, run swift along, and stop&mdash;<br />
Above the wheel my tired shoulders drop.<br />
I leave my seat, and slowly move away ...<br />
Cold is the wind: the clouds are grey,<br />
I only wish my room to gain,<br />
And in some book forget my pain,<br />
And lose myself in fancied dreams<br />
Across Titania's golden streams.<br />

With dross which they regret when they are old.<br />
<br />
What splendid hours of your life are these<br />
When youth and childhood wander hand in hand,<br />
And give you freely all which best can please&mdash;<br />
Laughter and friends and dreams of Fairyland!<br />
Mourn not the seasons past with useless tears,<br />
But greet the pleasure of the coming years!<br />

'Tis strange to leave this world of woods and hills,<br />
This world of little farms, and shady mills,&mdash;<br />
Of fields, and water-meadows fair,<br />
Upon some sad and shadowy day<br />
When all the skies are overcast and grey,<br />
And climb up through the gloomy air,<br />
And ever hurry higher still, and higher,<br />
Till underneath you lies a far-flung shire<br />
All sober-hued beneath the ceiling pale<br />
Of crawling clouds, whose barrier soon you reach,<br />
And through their clammy vapours swiftly sail,<br />
Their chill defences hoping soon to breach&mdash;<br />
To see no skies above, no ground below,<br />
And in that nothingness toss to and fro<br />
Is no sweet moment&mdash;will it never cease?&mdash;<br />
Climbing and diving, thrown from side to side,&mdash;<br />
All suddenly there comes a sense of peace<br />
And o'er a wondrous scenery we glide.<br />
O! what a splendour! Deep the cloudless blue<br />
Whose sparkling azure has a gorgeous hue<br />
On earth you know not&mdash;flaming bright the sun<br />
Which shines upon a landscape, snowy-white<br />
With all its power of unsullied light!<br />
Deep in the shadowy valleys do we run,<br />
And then above the towering summits soar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span><br />
And see for far-thrown miles yet, more and more,<br />
Great mountain-ranges, rolling, white and soft,<br />
With shadowy passes, cool, and huge, and dim,<br />
Where, surely, angels wander as they hymn<br />
Their happy songs, which wing their way aloft<br />
To Him who made the sun&mdash;the azure deep&mdash;<br />
And all this gleaming land of peace and sleep.<br />
Alone I wander o'er this virgin land&mdash;<br />
All, all for me&mdash;below the ploughman plods<br />
Along his furrows, and with restless hand<br />
The sower hurls his seed among the clods&mdash;<br />
They cannot see the sun&mdash;grey is their sky,&mdash;<br />
<i>I</i> see the sun&mdash;the heaven's blue&mdash;on high!<br />
But I am human, and must e'en descend;<br />
I bid farewell to all this lovely scene,<br />
And plunge deep in a cloud&mdash;When will it end,<br />
This hazy voyage?&mdash;See! the chequered green,<br />
The scattered farmsteads, and the quiet sea,<br />
Sunless and dim, come hurrying up to me.<br />

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
